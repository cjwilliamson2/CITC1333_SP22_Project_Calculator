This is a simple calculator project built for CITC 1333 Linux LPIC-I.

You can run the calculator script by downloading it to a system with a bash shell (or simimlar shell like zsh), such as Linux/Unix/MacOS.

To run the script, change the permissions of the calculator.sh file by issuing the chmod 764 calculator.sh command on the terminal.

Finally, start the script by running ./calculator.sh

The script can perform three types of calculations as listed below:
 
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  
You can perform an operation by typing in the number at the prompt, then typing in two more numbers. The result will be printed to stdout.
